# BotCrayon
I am BotCrayon, created by CommonCrayon. My function is to check for map updates on the CSGO Steam Workshop.

Special Thanks to Fluffy and Squidski.

TO USE:
Create your own:
1 - bot_token.txt = Insert your bot token here.
2 - log_channel.txt = Insert the channel id where you want the Bot to log.
3 - steamkey.txt = Insert your Steam API key here. 
4 - checker_log.txt = This is where all the console log will go.

Have Fun!
